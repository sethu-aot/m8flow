# Workflows

CI, releases and deployments run on the DevX reusable workflows
([AOT-Technologies/devx-reusable-workflows](https://github.com/AOT-Technologies/devx-reusable-workflows)),
pinned to a release commit (`v1.3.0`). DevX holds the pipeline logic; this
repository holds one small caller per component and that component's
configuration.

## Components

| Component | Caller | CI config | CD config | Image (ECR, us-east-2) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Backend (also celery worker and flower) | `backend-cicd.yaml` | `m8flow-backend/devx-ci.yaml` | `m8flow-backend/devx-config.yaml` | `m8flow-backend` |
| Designer (primary UI) | `designer-cicd.yaml` | `m8flow-designer/devx-ci.yaml` | `m8flow-designer/devx-config.yaml` | `m8flow-designer` |
| Keycloak | `keycloak-cicd.yaml` | `keycloak-extensions/devx-ci.yaml` | `keycloak-extensions/devx-config.yaml` | `m8flow-keycloak` |
| Connector proxy | `connector-proxy-cicd.yaml` | `m8flow-connector-proxy/devx-ci.yaml` | `m8flow-connector-proxy/devx-config.yaml` | `m8flow-connector-proxy` |

Registry: `653405621825.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com`.

## What runs when

| Event | What happens |
|---|---|
| Pull request to `main` or `refactor/next-gen` | CI for each component whose files changed: build, tests, SAST, image build, image and SBOM scans. Nothing is published. |
| Push or merge to `main` or `refactor/next-gen` | The same CI. Nothing is published. |
| `release.yaml` (manual) | Creates the next `X.Y.Z-rc` tag and builds and pushes the selected components at that tag. It publishes; it does not deploy. |
| A component's caller, run manually | Deploys a released image to an environment (dev today). |

## Releasing

Actions → **Release** → Run workflow, on `main` (or `refactor/next-gen` until it
merges into main; any other branch is refused). It tags the branch it runs on:

- `tag_name`: leave empty to increment the patch of the latest tag, or set
  one (`2.0.0-rc` for the first release).
- `components`: `all`, or a single component.
- `dry_run`: resolves the tag only.

One message goes to Google Chat with every component's result, and each
component's build sends its own.

## Deploying

Actions → the component's workflow → Run workflow, with `environment` and the
released `image_uri`, e.g.
`653405621825.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/m8flow-backend:2.0.0-rc`.

The deploy patches the running workload's image (the backend's also patches
the celery worker and flower), then checks it:

| Component | Health check after the deploy |
|---|---|
| Backend | `GET https://sandbox.m8flow.ai/api/v1.0/readyz` |
| Designer | `GET https://sandbox.m8flow.ai/` |
| Keycloak | `GET https://sandbox.m8flow.ai/realms/m8flow/.well-known/openid-configuration` (5 minute window) |
| Connector proxy | rollout status (no public URL) |

If the rollout or the health check fails, the workload is rolled back to the
image it ran before the deploy, and the result message says so. `dry_run`
validates against the cluster and changes nothing.

The Deployments themselves come from the Helm charts in `m8flow-charts`; CD
only changes their image.

## Security scans

Every CI run reports, per component, Trivy (image), Semgrep (source) and Grype
(SBOM) findings by severity in the run summary, with the critical and high
findings listed, and attaches the full reports as artifacts. Code scanning
only lists alerts for the default branch, so the run summary is where to read
them.

The gate is `security.gate.fail_on` in each `devx-ci.yaml`. It is `none` for
now: everything is reported, nothing blocks, so the current findings can be
fixed first. `critical,high` makes new critical or high findings fail the
build.

## Notifications

Builds, releases and deploys post to Google Chat: passed, passed with
findings, failed (with the failing stage), published images, deploy results
and rollbacks. A missing webhook fails the run, except on a pull request from
a fork, which GitHub gives no secrets; that warns, and the push after the merge
notifies.

## Secrets and access

| Name | Kind | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `GOOGLE_CHAT_WEBHOOK` | secret | notifications |
| `SONAR_TOKEN` | secret | SonarQube (skipped when absent) |

AWS access is GitHub OIDC, no stored keys: `GitHubActions-ECS-m8flow` pushes
to ECR, and `m8flow-<env>-cicd-deploy-role` deploys to `m8flow-eks`.

## Other workflows

| Workflow | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `check-migrations.yml` | On every PR and push (about 15 seconds, so it can be a required check): every migration can be read and compiles, and the revision chain has one head (fails the run); destructive operations in a changed migration's `upgrade()` are flagged as warnings on the file and line. The checker's tests (`.github/scripts/test_check_migrations.py`) run first. |
| `build-base-image.yml` | Rebuilds the Python base image the backend builds on (weekly and on change). |
| `mcp-server-cicd.yaml` | MCP server CI/CD, unchanged by the move to DevX v1.3.0 (older DevX commit, `main`, Docker Hub). Not migrated yet. |
| `codex-pr-review.yml` | Automated pull request review. |
| `pr-notification.yml` | Pull request activity to Google Chat. |

## Known gaps

- Designer unit tests run and currently fail: six tests in
  `m8flow-designer/src/components/layout/AppShell.test.tsx`. Until they are
  fixed the designer's CI fails and a release builds no designer image (the
  other components still publish).
- Backend unit tests run and currently cannot install: `m8flow-backend/uv.lock`
  records an older hash for `vendor/m8flow_bpmn_core-0.1.1-py3-none-any.whl`,
  so `uv sync` refuses it. Until `uv lock` is run in `m8flow-backend` and
  committed, the backend's CI fails and a release builds no backend image.
- `m8flow-nats-consumer` and the notification worker are not ported to this
  branch, and `m8flow-node-wire-proxy` has no CI (it needs pre-built node-wire
  wheels).

## Upgrading DevX

Point every `uses:` line at the new release's commit SHA with the version as a
trailing comment, and read its CHANGELOG entry for any config changes.
